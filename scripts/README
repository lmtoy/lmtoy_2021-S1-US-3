Following up on the casaguide.

To execute the scripts, you need CASA and NEMO.
Best might be to create symlinks here if the files are somewhere else.
We need:

M100_LMT.fits                         LMT cube ; symlink to M100_97520_99703.fits ?

M100_Band3_12m_CalibratedData.ms      ALMA 12m calibrated measurement set
M100_Band3_7m_CalibratedData.ms       ALMA 7m calibrated measurement set
M100_TP_CO_cube.spw3.image.bl         ALMA TP calibrated image cube
