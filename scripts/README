Following up on the casaguide.


# Software

To execute the scripts, you need CASA and NEMO (LMTOY contains NEMO)


# Data

Best might be to create symlinks here if the files are somewhere else.
We need:

M100_LMT.fits                         LMT cube ; symlink to M100_97520_99703.fits ?

M100_Band3_12m_CalibratedData.ms      ALMA 12m calibrated measurement set
M100_Band3_7m_CalibratedData.ms       ALMA 7m calibrated measurement set
M100_TP_CO_cube.spw3.image.bl         ALMA TP calibrated image cube


# Scripts

M100_casaguide64.py    - convert the ALMA data into a combine and feather - takes about 20 mins
convert1.py            - convert LMA K to Jy/beam cube
mk_fluxes.sh           - make radial cumulative flux tables
cumflux.py             - plot radial cumulative flux


## A note on computing time

Currently CASA often still benefits from forcing it on one core. The core usage is staggering,
even though the elapsed time is only minor (but still in favor of running on 1 core):

   8 cores:    6715.37user 130.58system 20:46.18elapsed 549%CPU 
   1 core:     1128.20user  79.57system 20:19.85elapsed  99%CPU 

the latter needs the command

   OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 /usr/bin/time casa -c M100_casaguide64.py
